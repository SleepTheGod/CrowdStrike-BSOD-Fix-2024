This PowerShell script is designed to address a specific issue with CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity service, by stopping its service, removing a problematic driver file, and modifying the registry to disable a service. Let's break it down step by step:

Stop the CrowdStrike service
Stop-Service -Name "CSFalconService" -Force

This command stops the CrowdStrike Falcon service (CSFalconService). The -Force parameter ensures that the service is stopped even if it is running critical tasks.

Remove the problematic driver file
$driverPath = "C:\Windows\System32\drivers"

$driverFile = Get-ChildItem -Path $driverPath -Filter "C-00000291*.sys"

if ($driverFile) {

Remove-Item -Path $driverFile.FullName -Force

Write-Output "Successfully removed the driver file: $($driverFile.FullName)"

} else {

Write-Output "Driver file not found."

}

This section of the script sets the path to the drivers directory and then searches for a driver file matching the pattern "C-00000291*.sys". If such a file is found, it is removed using Remove-Item. A message is output indicating whether the file was successfully removed or not found.

Disable the Csagent service by modifying the registry
$registryPath = "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Csagent"

Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name "Start" -Value 4

This command modifies the Windows registry to disable the Csagent service. Setting the Start value to 4 configures the service to be disabled.

Start the CrowdStrike service
Start-Service -Name "CSFalconService"

Write-Output "CrowdStrike service has been restarted. The problematic driver file has been removed and Csagent service has been disabled."

Finally, the script restarts the CrowdStrike service and outputs a message indicating that the service has been restarted, the problematic driver file has been removed, and the Csagent service has been disabled.
